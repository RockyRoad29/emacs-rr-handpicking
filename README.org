* Description
This layer is basically a wrapper for the =rr/handpicking= package, with
separated keybindings file.

It is designed to help taking personal notes while reading a reference document,
which may be read-only.

It can also be used to reorganize a document, by moving sections of text from
source to destination buffers, or more generally, editing windows.

* Install
** As a layer in spacemacs
To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(rr/handpicking))
#+end_src

** As a simple emacs package
   Straightforward as there is no dependency to spacemacs at this stage.

 Load
  - file:local/handpicking/handpicking.el
  - file:keybindings.el
* Usage
** First define the reference buffer
From your destination buffer, call help:rr/handpicking-set-source-buffer

You'll be prompted to select a buffer by name, which is going to be the source
or reference buffer associated with current buffer.

Defines or redefines the source buffer to use for
handpicking to current buffer.

This is a convenience interactive function setting the
buffer-local variable help:rr/handpicking-source-buffer

This setting will be valid as long as your destination file is loaded in
emacs (or more precisely while your current buffer is alive).

:Note: It could default to help:other-buffer , but I think it is safer to let
the user be explicit about that. For the same reason, no key-binding is
attributed to this function.
:end:

When later using other functions of the handpicking module, this buffer will
be popped up in a window next to the one you're working in, without apparently
leaving it.
** Moving around reference buffer

You can move up and down your reference window by keeping [Ctrl+Shift] keys
pressed, and using up and down arrows to move one line at a time.

  - help:rr/handpicking-nextline
  - help:rr/handpicking-prevline

You can also directly jump to a specific word or pattern, see
  - help:rr/handpicking-lookup

** Moving text from one window to another

  - help:rr/handpicking-move

* Key bindings
They are chosen for their proximity on my keyboard layout (UK).

| Key Binding  | Function                    | Description                                                         |
|--------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~[C-S-down]~ | =#'rr/handpicking-nextline= | Move down one line in reference buffer                              |
| ~[C-S-up]~   | =#'rr/handpicking-prevline= | Move up one line in reference buffer                                |
| ~[M-S-up]~   | =#'rr/handpicking-lookup=   | Lookup for pattern in reference buffer                              |
| ~[C-@])~     | =#'rr/handpicking-copy=     | Copy one line from source to current buffer. This is also ~[C-S-']~ |
| ~[C-M-'])~   | =#'rr/handpicking-move=     | Move one or several lines from source to current buffer             |


On US keyboard, =#'rr/handpicking-copy= would be bound to ~[C-"]~, but I haven't
checked if the syntax is valid.

If you use french keyboard layout (azerty), the same keys locations would be :
| ~[C-Âµ]~   | =#'rr/handpicking-copy= | that is C-S-* |
| ~[C-M-*]~ | =#'rr/handpicking-move= |               |


:Note:
~[C-S-down]~ and ~[C-S-up]~ are included in org-mode keymap, but not used.

A simple hook make them available for /handpicking/ package.
